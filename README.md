## Problem 1: Make a simple todo list with a fade-in transition for new elements

1. There's a todo list
2. There's a text box to type a new todo
3. Clicking "Add" button should add the item to the list
4. The newly added item should fade-in


## Problem 2: Country - State drop down selection

1. Select the country in "Country" dropdown
2. This should enable the second dropdown for "State" with options for the selected Country

Both problems should be done in vanilla JS. Solve this on [codepen](http://codepen.io) and send me the link.
