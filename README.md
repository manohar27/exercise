1. There's a todo list
2. There's a text box to type a new todo
3. Clicking "Add" button should add the item to the list
4. The newly added item should fade-in

**NOTE: This above exercise should be done in vanilla Javascript only**
#### Here's how it might look like

## Problem 2: Country - State drop down selection

1. Select the country in "Country" dropdown
2. This should enable the second dropdown for "State" with options for the selected Country

**NOTE: This needs to be built in React, Pick any 3 countries and 3 states in each country for your mock data**
